A K-D Tree, or K-Dimensional Tree, is a data structure for organizing points in a K-dimensional space. It is a
binary search tree, where each node represents a K-dimensional point. Every non-leaf node in the tree acts as a
hyperplane, dividing the space into two partitions. This hyperplane is perpendicular to the chosen axis, which
is associated with one of the K dimensions. A normal Binary Search Tree is also a K-D Tree with K=1. Thus
we can say, that K-D Trees are a direct extension of the binary search tree.
# Objective
•To implement the K-D tree data structure.

•To perform nearest neighbour search in O(logn) time.

•To demonstrate this nearest neighbor search’s practical application.
